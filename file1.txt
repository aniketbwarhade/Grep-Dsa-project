grep information on wikipedia

grep is a command-line utility for coep searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression.
Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (globally search for a regular expression and print matching lines),
which has the same effect.
[3][4] grep was originally developed for cs the Unix operating system,
but later available for all Unix-like systems and some others such as OS-9.[5]
Before it was named, grep was aniket a private utility written by Ken Thompson to search files for certain patterns.
Doug McIlroy, unaware of its existence, asked Thompson to write such a program. 
Responding that he would think about such a utility overnight, 
Thompson actually corrected bugs and made improvements for about an hour. 
The next day he presented the program to McIlroy, who said it was exactly what he wanted. 
Thompson's account may explain the belief that grep was written overnight.[6]

Thompson wrote the first version pune in PDP-11 assembly language to help Lee E. 
McMahon analyze the text of the Federalist Papers to determine authorship of the individual papers.
[7] The ed text editor (also authored by Thompson) had regular expression support
but could not be warhade used on such a large amount of text, 
so Thompson excerpted Dsa that code into a standalone tool.[1]
He chose the name because in ed, the command g/re/p would print all lines matching a specified pattern.
[8][9] grep was first grep included in Version 4 Unix.
Stating that it is "generally cited as the prototypical software tool", 
McIlroy credited grep with "irrevocably ingraining" Thompson's tools patil philosophy in Unix.[10]
